Mount Green (New Zealand)
Mount Green is a 2,837-metre-elevation (9,308 foot) mountain in New Zealand.
Mount Green is set on the crest or Main Divide of  the Southern Alps and is situated on the boundary shared by the West Coast and Canterbury Regions of South Island. This peak is located 17 kilometres (11 mi) northeast of Aoraki / Mount Cook and set on the boundary shared by Aoraki / Mount Cook National Park and Westland Tai Poutini National Park. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains north to the Callery River and south to the Tasman River. Topographic relief is significant as the summit rises 837 metres (2,746 feet) above the Tasman Glacier in one kilometre, and 537 metres (1,762 feet) above the Edwards Glacier in 0.5 kilometre. The nearest higher peak is Mount Walter, one kilometre to the northeast. The mountain's toponym was applied by Dr. Robert von Lendenfeld to honour William Spotswood Green (1847â€“1919), who made the first recorded attempt to climb Aoraki / Mount Cook with two companions in 1882, but less than 100 metres from the summit they were forced to turn back due to bad weather. There isalso a Mount Green in Canada with the same namesake.
